## Welcome to the Wardrobe Manager repository

This repository contains the source code for:

* [Wardrobe Manager](https://github.com/codingburgas/2223-otj-11-project-repo-csharp-VLMladenov19/tree/main/src/WardrobeManager)

### 1. Introduction

My project is aimed at making it easier to dress in what we like and have by making it easier to look through our wardrobe by completely virtualizing the process of looking through our wardrobe.

Through the app, users will be able to **create** new outfits by selecting the clothes they have **added** to their virtual wardrobe. All of the clothes that have been added will have corresponding photos to help with creating a mental picture of what the outfit itself will look like. Clothes will be **viewable** by creation date and can also be shared via a link.
